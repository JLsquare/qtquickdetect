# About QTQuickDetect

QTQuickDetect is a powerful application for image and video analysis, leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning models. It provides functionalities for object detection, segmentation, classification, and pose estimation.

## How It Works

The application utilizes the following technologies:

- **Ultralytics YOLO**: For robust and efficient object detection models. [More info](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
- **Torchvision**: For a variety of pre-trained models and weights. [More info](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models.html#)
- **OpenCV**: For image processing tasks such as reading, writing, and manipulating images and videos. [More info](https://opencv.org/)
- **PyQt6**: For the user interface, providing a seamless and intuitive user experience. [More info](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/)

While Ultralytics and Torchvision provide the models and weights, the utility functions are custom implemented to ensure flexibility and performance. The application is modular, making it easy to add entire pipelines for additional tasks and models.

## Authors

QTQuickDetect was developed by Jean-Loup Mellion and Gatien Da Rocha, students at the University IUT Vannes, France.
